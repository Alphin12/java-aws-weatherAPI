Step 1: Set Up Your Project Structure
Create Project Directory:

Create a new directory for your project, e.g., weather-api.
Create Subdirectories:

Inside the weather-api directory, create the following folders:
lambda: For your Lambda function classes.
model: For your data model classes.
utils: For utility classes.
Create Java Classes:

Inside the lambda folder, create:
GetItemFunction.java
PostItemFunction.java
Inside the model folder, create:
WeatherData.java
Inside the utils folder, create:
DependencyFactory.java
Step 2: Implement the Java Classes
WeatherData.java (Model):

Define the data structure for weather data. Include fields for city name, weather ID, main weather type, description, and icon.
Implement constructors and getter/setter methods.
DependencyFactory.java (Utils):

Create methods to initialize the DynamoDB Enhanced Client and retrieve the table name from environment variables.
PostItemFunction.java (Lambda):

Implement the RequestHandler interface.
In the constructor, initialize the DynamoDB client, table name, and table schema.
In handleRequest, extract the city name from the request parameters, fetch weather data from the OpenWeather API, and save it to DynamoDB.
Handle exceptions and return appropriate HTTP responses.
GetItemFunction.java (Lambda):

Implement the RequestHandler interface similarly.
In the constructor, initialize the DynamoDB client and table schema.
In handleRequest, scan the DynamoDB table for all weather data and return it as a JSON response.
Handle exceptions and log errors appropriately.
Step 3: Build Your Project
Install Dependencies:

Ensure you have Maven or your chosen build tool set up to manage dependencies defined in pom.xml.
Compile the Code:

Run the build command (e.g., mvn clean package if using Maven) to compile your Java code and package it into a JAR file.
Step 4: Set Up AWS and Serverless Framework
Install the AWS CLI:

Install the AWS CLI and configure it using your AWS credentials:
bash
Copy code
aws configure
Install the Serverless Framework:

Install the Serverless Framework using Node.js:
bash
Copy code
npm install -g serverless
Step 5: Deploy to AWS
Deploy Your Application:

In the root of your project, run:
bash
Copy code
serverless deploy
This command packages your application, creates necessary resources (like API Gateway and DynamoDB), and deploys your Lambda functions.
Record the API Gateway Endpoint:

After deployment, take note of the API endpoint URLs for testing your application.
Step 6: Test the API
Test the POST Endpoint:

Use a tool like Postman or curl to send a POST request to add weather data:
bash
Copy code
curl -X POST 'https://<api-id>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/weather?city=<CityName>'
Verify that the weather data is stored in DynamoDB.
Test the GET Endpoint:

Send a GET request to retrieve all weather data:
bash
Copy code
curl -X GET 'https://<api-id>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/weather/all'
Check that it returns the correct weather data in JSON format.
Step 7: Set Up CI/CD with GitHub Actions
Create a GitHub Actions Workflow:

In your GitHub repository, create the directory .github/workflows.
Add a CI/CD YAML File:

Inside the workflows directory, create a ci-cd.yml file.
Define the workflow to build the Java project and deploy it to AWS whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.
Configure GitHub Secrets:

In your repository settings, add secrets for AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY to enable GitHub Actions to deploy your application securely.
Summary
By following these steps, youâ€™ll have a fully functional AWS Weather App that utilizes Lambda functions to interact with DynamoDB and an external weather API. You can deploy and manage the app easily, and with the CI/CD pipeline, your application will automatically update on pushes to the main branch.
